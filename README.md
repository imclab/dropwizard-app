dropwizard-app
==============

 Utility classes for building better standalone applications with dropwizard.

 Already done:
 - integration with swagger (based on axemblr/dropwizard-swagger)
 - command to stop jetty from any thread (i.e. from servlet)

 Coming soon:
 - daemon mode (probably using http://commons.apache.org/daemon or http://yajsw.sourceforge.net/)
 - auto-updates (on restart and with push)
 - auto-discovery of other Dropwizard Apps
